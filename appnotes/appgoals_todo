#==================
# TASKS QUEUE (short-term)
#==================
# todo short-term
# generally ordred by decerasing importance ,by section

# aesthetic stuff
. draw background with grobs (lib grid)
. do image effects (lib magick)
. do some cool animations for transitions (lib magick)

# animation improvements
. print animation slides as JPEG frames
. manage JPEG frame loads with magick

# Graphical interface
. make viewports with stats
. run multiple tasks simultaneous

# RIDE UI
. tdist counter (adds tdist updater to ride display)
. num obstacles encountered
. add ride map?

# GAME END
. show total score at endagme ui

# OBSTACLE NOTE
. random obstacle symbol for each encounter?

# GAME ENGINE (score and stats modifiers)
. bike condition modifies obstacle #
. bike condition modifies obstacle impact (bcond diff magnitude)
 bonus for rides completed. score modified?
.. could impact idle task modifiers (e.g. bcond dec on "break " outcome)
..decrease likelihood "break" outcome (e.g. likelihood task outcome = "break")

add error log (track new errs)
. mileage modifies maintenance -> bcond (NOT DONE)
. make runnable from cl

# BLOG STUFF
. make gif ("make_gif.R")

# APP DETAILS
. add save option with caching
. add GITIGNORE
. rebuild with Rlib "magick"???

# todo long-term
. app launch specs (NOT DONE)
.  bundle app as executable
. port into python
. supports unit testing

. plots showing current player stats

#=================
# TASKS COMPLETED
#=================
# tasks that rsolve mwinoaksdf no issues
. customize ride (set bikestr)

# APP DETAILS
. fix idle (coordinate animation and options)
. adds logo
. use source, obviate need for .Rdata objects

# RIDE UI

# OBSTACLE NOTE
. randomize obstacle symbol?
. add obstacle symbol vavr

# GAME ENGINE (score and stats modifiers)
. between rides, either "maintain" or "repair" (DONE)
.. chance to "break" bike (bcond reduces)
.. add option to stop game === > jump to end game ui

. adds obstacle message about bcond (whether increased or decreased)
. add bcond to end idle message
