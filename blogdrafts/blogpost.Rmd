This post is about creating a truly basic/barebones app called `scootersim`, within the confines of R, a language commonly used in data science. 

# Game guts

Using R presents some challenges, and it took some planning to organize simulation elements. I managed to make progress with just a couple of dependencies. I chose `grid` for acii text animations and `svDialogs` for managing ui.

This 

management of nested functions

unit testing examples?



## Sequence of events

## Score formula

The score, as in most computer games, is an imaginary points system, which I have defined here as:

Dt - (Nc + 0.5 * Ns)

Where 

1. Dt is total "distance" traveled (just an integer counter in this case), 
2. Nc is the number of "crashes" (rides where bike stops), and 
3. Ns is the number of "stops" (rides where player stops riding before end of ride).

# App data

I've designed this "app" (e.g. simplistic simulation) with modularity in mind. In other words, I've taken measures to ensure weights on score conditions are tolerant to large magnitude modifications.







A. "inspect bike"
A1. "maintain"
A2. ""
B. "drive"
B1. "obstacle encounter"
