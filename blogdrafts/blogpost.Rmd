Scootersim simulates a bike and bike maintenance. Here, I describe in detail how the sim app works

This explores elements of app creation. Touched-on themes include plot auto-updating and interplay of classes, functions, and probabilistic models. All of this will be performed within the confines of base R and several key dependencies.

Wheee!

# Outline

The gist of this app is as follows:

1. 


# Interplay of classes and functions

The meat of the simulation is the properties of the `scooter` class. Subclasses of `scooter` include properties in `bike` and other physical properties (fuel and weight).


in the scooter class and its components, contained in the "bike" subclass.

# Scheduled plot updates

The simulation part of this app 

# Scheduled element updates

R is object-oriented, but we'll use functions and classes to make the bike "run". 


```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
