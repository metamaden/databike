Remember tamagotchis? Those little electronic monsters you had to feed and maintain? 

# Scootersim intro

Scootersim simulates a bike and bike maintenance. Here, I describe in detail how the sim app works

This explores elements of app creation. Touched-on themes include plot auto-updating and interplay of classes, functions, and probabilistic models. All of this will be performed within the confines of base R and several key dependencies.

# Outline

The gist of this app is as follows:

1. 


# Interplay of classes and functions

The meat of the simulation is the properties of the `scooter` class. Subclasses of `scooter` include properties in `bike` and other physical properties (fuel and weight).


in the scooter class and its components, contained in the "bike" subclass.

# Conclusions

Here we touched on several key themes important for data scraping, scheduled script runs, and autoupdating graphics. These were hidden behind the joy of scooter maintenance simulation!
