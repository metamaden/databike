With covid everywhere and idle time, I took a stab at making a game... in R! Crazy right? This. is. scootersim!

# Game sequence

The score, as in most computer games, is an imaginary points system, which I have defined here as:

Dt - (Nc + 0.5 * Ns)

Where 

1. Dt is total "distance" traveled (just an integer counter in this case), 
2. Nc is the number of "crashes" (rides where bike stops), and 
3. Ns is the number of "stops" (rides where player stops riding before end of ride).



A. "inspect bike"
A1. "maintain"
A2. ""
B. "drive"
B1. "obstacle encounter"
