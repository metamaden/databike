# `databike`: an app about scooter upkeep

In databike, the user makes decisions about maintenance (e.g. repair, maintain, or do nothing) and during obstacles encountered on rides (e.g. whether to quit or continue). These decisions impact the bike condition and total mileage or ride distance. The basic “user interface” consists of graphics (text/ascii art, printed in sequence), and user dialogues and notifications (pop-up windows with text and options buttons).

# App run

1. Download the repo, R, the svDialogues, and grid packages. 
2. Navigate to the root directory (e.g. `cd Documents/GitHub/databike`).
3. From command line, run:

```
R
source(app.R)
```
