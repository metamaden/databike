# Overview

Here, I describe the process of designing `databike`, an interactive application about scooter upkeep. The app code is available at the [databike repository](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metamaden/databike/). For myself, this was quite the novel undertaking. I will periodically share significant lessons learned as the app continues to develop.

# App design

The goal was to create a command line-runnable application the includes user interactivity and some form of a hook  or "gameplay loop." These goals should be met while adhering to principles of reproducible application development.

# Some header

Here's a formulation of the steps in the classic Monty Hall problem, as described above:

1. list item 1
2. list item 2

* bulleted list
  + item 1
  + item 2

*emphasize text*

```
# generic code chunk
```
