# GAME ENGINE (score and stats modifiers)
. bike condition modifies obstacle #
. bike condition modifies obstacle impact (bcond diff magnitude)
 bonus for rides completed. score modified?
.. could impact idle task modifiers (e.g. bcond dec on "break " outcome)
..decrease likelihood "break" outcome (e.g. likelihood task outcome = "break")

add error log (track new errs)
. mileage modifies maintenance -> bcond (NOT DONE)
. make runnable from cl

# BLOG STUFF
